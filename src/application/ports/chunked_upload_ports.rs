//! Chunked Upload Port - Application layer abstraction for resumable chunked uploads.
//!
//! This module defines the port (trait) and DTOs for chunked/resumable upload
//! operations, keeping the application and interface layers independent of
//! the specific upload implementation (TUS-like protocol, S3 multipart, etc.).

/// Default chunk size (5 MB) — optimised for parallel transfers.

pub const CHUNKED_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD: usize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;

/// Algorithm used by the client-side chunk checksum.
///
/// The wire format is `?checksum=<hex>&checksumalg=<name>` (or the
/// equivalent header pair for older clients that send only `Content-MD5`).
/// Clients that omit `checksumalg` are assumed to mean MD5 — that's the
/// algorithm baked into the legacy `Content-MD5` header (RFC 1864), TUS-
/// like upload protocols, and S3 multipart ETags.
///
/// Three supported variants, all from already-declared dependencies:
/// - `Md5` — legacy default; weak cryptographically but fine for
///   transport-integrity checks under TLS.
/// - `Sha256` — industry-standard, FIPS-compliant, widely supported by
///   sync clients (AWS S3 also accepts SHA-256 trailers).
/// - `Blake3` — fastest of the three; already used by the blob-storage
///   layer, so the chunk-level integrity check and the assembled-file
///   dedup hash use the same algorithm when clients opt in.
///
/// Skipped intentionally: SHA-1 (deprecated, broken), CRC32 (too weak for
/// integrity claims). Both can be added if a real client need appears.
